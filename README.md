test cases

files with names that start with "mytest" are tests that call YOUR implemented functions (actual results)
files with names that start with "test" are tests that call GIVEN implemented functions (expected results)
script.sh runs both and compares the two
PASS = no differences between the output of given functions and your implemented functions
FAIL = differences between the output of given functions and your implemented functions

1. add all files to pa4 directory
2. might have to add permissions to run script:
   %chmod 777 script.sh
3. run script:
   %./script.sh
